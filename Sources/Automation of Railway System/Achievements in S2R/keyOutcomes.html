<h3>Key Outcomes</h3>
<p>
	Key outcomes for automation and autonomy:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Activity undertaken in the “Railway network capacity increase (ATO up to GoA 4)”.  ATO GoA2 operations will be demonstrated, supported by Traffic Management System (TMS) interface integrated with ATO. And relying on the future Adaptable Communication System (ACS) the proposal for the next generation of telecommunications.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cybersecurity embedded by design in products and the use of scientific tools such as formal methods. The introduction of moving block systems, positioning technologies and on-board train integrity features provide a more efficient approach towards the evolution of the Control Command Systems (CCS), contributing to increasing capacity and reducing trackside equipment.
