<h1>Automation of the Railway System</h1>
<h3>It include Automated Train Operation (ATO)</h3>
<p>
	Railways will benefit from automated and autonomous systems as demonstrated at urban level by the CBTC (Communication Based Train Control) that supports advanced automation of many urban lines.
	Today, the deployment of European Rain Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is the basis for a progressively more automated interconnected railway system. ERTMS combined with new technologies and sensors would allow “smarter” trains running more efficiently, closer together, more safely and at the same time overcoming the challenge of driver shortage.
