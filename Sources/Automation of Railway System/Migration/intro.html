<h1>How to Ensure Migration to 2030</h1>
<p>
	The path towards more automation and autonomy at a system level will be eased by the development a common and shared architecture based on a modular framework as a reference. It should facilitate migration strategies and adaptations to specific business challenges while supporting the introduction of state-of-the-art technology (e.g. track and vehicles sensors, 5G, formal proofing, quantum computing, new human machine cooperation strategies).
	<p>
		Migration towards new solutions need also to be anticipated:
		<ul>
			<li>trackside control line detection should only be considered as an intermediate step for automation on the non-ERTMS equipped part of the network;</li>
			<li>during the migration period, suitable driver Human Machine Interface (HMI) for remote train operations and automated train operation (GoA2 to GoA4) will be necessary to keep a high-level performing driver;</li>
			<li>the technical complexity arising from non-harmonised operational rules needs to be analysed in order to identify opportunities for simplified technology either emerging from newly harmonised rules or solving “by design” the diverging local constraints usually exported to the human factor;</li>
			<li>standards and interoperable systems and sub-systems (ATO on board, ETCS on board) should be sought as far as possible to preserve the competitiveness of the mode.</li>
		</ul>
