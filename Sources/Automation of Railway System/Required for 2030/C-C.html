<h1>Towards Next Generation of Control-Command 4.0</h1>
<p>
	It will help to leverage the benefits of the combination of autonomous, intelligent and highly responsive vehicles able to communicate with each other and with the intelligent infrastructure.
	<p>
		Migration towards the new generation of control command needs global and innovative approaches:
		<ul>
			<li>various levels for the control and management of the system (infrastructure and vehicles) in order to optimise capacity and avoid conflicts;</li>
			<li>cybersecurity will be managed by design and routed in the physical layer;</li>
			<li>trackside components dedicated to the control-command operations will have migrated from the ground to the cloud. The only essential field elements in the track that will remain will be “Smart radio-connected all-in-all wayside objects” for switches and level crossing. The controllers for these devices will have to be connected via an internet-based interface to route management;</li>
			<li>virtual train configurations composed of non-mechanically coupled vehicles (platooning) will maximise the benefits of automation;</li>
			<li>•	close collaboration with other mobility sectors will allow to integrate new technologies within railway systems while developing the necessary technical interfaces facilitating multimodal transport services.</li>
		</ul>
