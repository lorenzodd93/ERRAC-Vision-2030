<h1>Automation of the Logistics Chain</h1>
<p>
	Digitalisation will strengthen the end-usersâ€™ communication and set up a direct link to the production process of the rail freight system and to other transport modes.
	<p>
		New solutions for the automation of the logistic chain will help expanding the initial developments at the layer of communication, production process, assets and services:
		<ul>
			<li>the automation activities for freight trains, marshalling yards and intermodal terminals need to enter the next step of maturity in the direction of a fully automated rail freight system;</li>
			<li>intelligence of the assets especially on rail freight wagons need to be linked to the Internet of things (IoT).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Running trains on GoA 4 is the next step. Real time information provided by intelligent assets and IoT will increase the level of automation of the production process towards full automation.
