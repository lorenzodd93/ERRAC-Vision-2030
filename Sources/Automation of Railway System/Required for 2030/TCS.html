<h1>Advanced Interoperable Train Control systems</h1>
<p>
	These will deliver more flexibility in operation therefore better real-time adaption to the demand and economic competitiveness by increased capacity.
	<p>
		Key technology enablers:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>ACS/FRMCS</b>: will lead to more fast, safe, secure, reliable and high capacity connectivity in railway system;
			</li>
			<li>
				Global Navigation Satellite Systems (<b>GNSS</b>), notably Galileo: will lead to more safe, reliable and accurate train positioning.	
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Main objectives:
		<ul>
			<li>Advanced train control and monitoring systems, in particular traction, brakes and doors control aiming to better performance;</li>
			<li>A reliable environment perception through the identification of all external hazards (obstacle detection, environmental monitoring) that is essential to enable on-board decision-making intelligence (before possible collision but also after collision to speed up the recovery time);</li>
			<li>For urban rail, advanced train control systems will continue to be developed around CBTC solutions and new autonomy capabilities.</li>
		</ul>
