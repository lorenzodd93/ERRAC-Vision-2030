<h1>Advanced Traffic Management (TMS)</h1>
<p>
	It can help energy optimisation, support operational resilience and flexibility while increasing infrastructure capacity. 
	<p>
		Advanced traffic management solutions will emerge by integrating studies, tools and solutions developed in Shift2Rail, it will also benefit from new technologies:
		<ul>
			<li>artificial intelligence to support operation and to optimise the management of resources. This will lead to better predictive capabilities, on demand solutions and smoother intermodal connections;</li>
			<li>data mining and management in order to facilitate the integration of various technical systems supporting mobility services. Scenario-based simulation will support decision-making while historical data can support machine learning, and therefore contribute to progressive decision automation;</li>
			<li>traffic management application will become independent from the physical system and leverage a common data lake for more efficient railway traffic management;</li>
			<li>new standards for remote control and drive functions will deliver enhanced levels of automation, helping to smoothen and maximise traffic on railway lines.</li>
		</ul>
