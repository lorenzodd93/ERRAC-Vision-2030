<h1>Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
<p>
	Some key enablers for intelligent and autonomous vehicles still need to be developed: 
	<ul>
		<li>infrastructure and environment monitoring: through sensors, and artificial intelligence with long range abilities offering cooperative mechanisms and communication and a more global intelligence;</li>
		<li>self-healing/management of vehicles (e.g. door management, intelligent closed-circuit television (CCTV), smart subsystems in general) ready for remote control and supervision;</li>
		<li>vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication in order to decrease the costs of operations on low traffic lines, progressing towards a less centralised system of supervision and therefore facilitating the autonomous control-command of the train;</li>
		<li>lower and/or lighter vehicles such as a pod/pod carrier concept, being adapted to the traveller needs, are permitted by the greater flexibility of the control-command system. They are easily connected by virtual coupling (platooning) forming virtual trains to optimise the use of the infrastructure;</li>
		<li>advanced vehicle-to-vehicle communication and AI-technologies, which will enable Swarm Intelligence (SI) whereby autonomous units cooperate in aggregates (swarms), running as single car or as virtual train configuration;</li>
		<li>connection of railway vehicles to the road infrastructure by Intelligent Transport System (ITS), which should ease connection to other modes and thus permit more connections for a complete mobility system: for instance, the management of level crossings, passenger exchanges or smooth street-tram operation.</li>
	</ul>
