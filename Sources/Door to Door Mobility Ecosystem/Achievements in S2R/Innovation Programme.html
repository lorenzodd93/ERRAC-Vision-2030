<h1>IT Solutions for Attractive Railway Services</h1>
<p>
	This programme includes the pre-trip phase, with planning, booking and ticketing, support during the trip, with personalised information (including ancillary services), in-door navigation, re-allocation of the journey in case of disruption and after sales capabilities. To achieve this, passengers have access to the services through a travel companion, a personal application which collects the user/citizen preferences and stores the rights to travel in a protected wallet.

	From the <b>Mobility Service</b> providers point of view, it provides a <b>web-based interoperability mechanism</b> that eases the integration into the ecosystem without changing the legacy systems, reducing the cost of adapting the interfaces of providers participating in service bundles offered as-a-service.
</p>
<p>
	Moreover, thanks to the <b>Business Analytics platform</b>, the Mobility Service providers will better adapt their level of service to the passengers’ demand and to optimise their operations
</p>
<p>
	This IP’s developments are targeted to reach Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6/7 (system prototype demonstration in operational environment) and are including different experimentations in the context of the <b>Mobility as a System (MaaS)</b> approach.
</p>
<p>
	The extension in Horizon Europe should target a full deployment, with the extension to any other modes of transport and business models and should be extended to the freight context.
