	Facilitate the emergence of <b>MaaS platforms</b> through technical standards, business models and regulatory frames, in particular use and sharing of data. Rail end-users/citizens need accurate and real-time information about the multi-modal offer, taking into account their preferences, and proposing a personalised support before, during and after the journey through an electronic travel assistant/ companion. Emerging MaaS platforms are providing rail end-users/citizens with personalised service bundles offered through multiple delivery schemes, including through service contract and subscriptions, that deliver mobility solutions optimised to their specific circumstances, regardless of modal planning, booking and ticketing mechanisms. They automate contract execution, payment, settlement and accounting across the network of personal and business service providers involved in delivering tailored, end-to-end customer-centric mobility.
