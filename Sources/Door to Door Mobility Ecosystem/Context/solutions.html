	The emergence of new transport modes allows cities and regions to propose multimodal mobility solutions (including shared and on demand) to address the traffic congestion issue and enhance the attractiveness of the public transport. For end-users/citizens (passenger and freight) it will provide a seamless, customised i.e. personalised, efficient and cost-effective end to end journeys, whatever the mode of transport. This means providing seamless information, but mostly improving the offer: connections between modes, accessibility, improved coverage and adaptability of the overall offer. For operators and transport administrators it will provide intelligent and adaptive multi-modal traffic management system to ensure seamless end to end journeys to rail end-users/citizens.

		To meet the objective to foster the integration and the quality of service of the rail mode to remain the backbone of multimodality, new solutions must be developed.
