	For rail freight, modular freight wagon designs allow a seamless and efficient horizontal change of goods and loading units. Intelligent freight wagons are connected to intermodal terminals, marshalling yards, end-users/citizens sidings and cross modal nodes to provide a high-performance access to the rail system.
