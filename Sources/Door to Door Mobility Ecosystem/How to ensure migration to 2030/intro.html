<h1>How to Ensure Migration to 2030</h1>
<p>
	The migration path is highly dependent on the maturity of the businesses. If no major disruption is expected in the go to market, we can easily correlate the migration with the TRLs of the solutions. But the problem becomes more complex when business disruptions can emerge, with new business models, different go to market, or when the migration requires prior agreements with stakeholders who are outside the railway ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
	Some of the new solutions, related to technical improvements (techno push), will be proposed incrementally to the market as soon as they reach adequate TRL, and will continue to use rather standard Request for Information/ Request for Proposal (RFI/RFP) processes. All solutions relying on improved communication (5G), cloud platform, big data, analytics and AI will progress at the speed of the use of these new technologies.

<p>
	The migration of more disruptive solutions, in which the role of the stakeholders and the business models evolve, and which require coordination between different transport sectors (e.g. MOCCs or multimodal traffic management systems) is more difficult to predict. These new systems are modifying the existing businesses, giving a reinforced coordination role to the transport authorities, and requiring certainly more (European) political actions, regulatory environment, and potentially new standards. As an example, regulations for open data are certainly instrumental to foster the deployment of some of the proposed systems. For these solutions, watching the emerging trends, for instance around MaaS paradigm, and using them as business enabler, is essential.
