<h1>Achievements in Shift2Rail</h1>
<p>
	Different aspects of sustainability have been the subject of recent EU projects (OSIRIS, MERLIN, RIVAS) and are further developed in Shift2Rail. Some of these developments are useful building blocks which will enable a more integrated coverage in the future.
</p>
<p>
	The proposed approach is focused on the following topics:
	<ul>
		<li><b>new propulsion systems</b>: Technologies to progress towards full electrification without catenary;</li>
		<li><b>digitalisation</b>: With a wide amount of new data and analysis tools under development, there are new opportunities to address the energy consumption and efficiency problems in a holistic way.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Future work will also develop further some fundamental activities already started in Shift2Rail, which are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>energy efficiency in general</b>: New lighter materials, design concepts or new technologies for subsystems;</li>
		<li><b>noise & vibration reduction with better prediction techniques and mitigation measures</b>, which are key for the integration of rail in populated areas.</li>
	</ul>
