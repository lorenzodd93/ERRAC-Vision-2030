<h3>Deployment of digitalisation</h3>
<p>
	A precondition to ensure the migration to the new technologies developed is to ensure the widespread deployment of digital systems across the railway system and mobility in general. This requires:
	<ul>
		<li>standardisation of critical aspects of the digital system (interfaces, protocols, communications, data structures) to be able to integrate the different subsystems;</li>
		<li>develop a clear and sufficiently open business and legal framework at business level that allows fruitful use of data and information by different stakeholders involved in operation and asset management, which often have conflicting requirements;</li>
		<li>promote the effective integration of existing information systems: Many individual information systems are currently available in the EU railways, thus not exploiting the potentiality of big data analysis.</li>
	</ul>
