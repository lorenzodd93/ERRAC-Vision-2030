<h1>How to Ensure Migration to 2030</h1>
<p>
	Horizon Europe is expected to support a new integrated approach to energy based on digital solutions, and to tackle the specific issue of full electrification through alternative propulsion systems. It will also push several key technologies to a high maturity level for implementation in railways. In this context, requirements to ensure migration are found in two main lines: <b>introduction of new propulsion systems and deployment of digitalisation.</b>

	Concerning the reduction of noise emissions and vibrations, the new predictive techniques and analysis methods developed within Shift2Rail should form the basis for developing new silent components and for deploying noise and vibration mitigation measures. Predicting the behaviour of vehicles and their components during the design phase will allow the concentration of effort from the start on noise and vibration sources and propagation channels, including infrastructure, and be more effective and cost efficient in their mitigation. Only approaching the noise and vibration issue from a holistic point of view will provide the expected results in terms of reduced emissions and increased friendliness towards rail transport.
