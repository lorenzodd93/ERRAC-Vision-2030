<h3>Introduction of new propulsion systems</h3>
<p>
	Requirements to push for migration are:
	<ul>
		<li>clear and wide demonstration of technical and economic feasibility, including different use cases in the regional / intercity segment and possibly in the urban segment;</li>
		<li>assurance of acceptance by standardisation and regulation: It will be necessary to work from an early phase on the adaption of regulation and standards to consider (and even favour) the use of the cleanest technology being developed;</li>
		<li>dual power concepts developed in Shift2Rail are implemented and enable electrified last mile transports on non-electrified lines.</li>
	</ul>
