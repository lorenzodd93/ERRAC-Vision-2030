<h3>Holistic energy management approach for railways</h3>
<p>
	The <i>energy consumption</i> of trains in regular operation is influenced by many different factors, and therefore complementary technological developments should be undertaken to reduce it. Specific technological enablers to be developed are:
	<ul>
		<li> 
			<b>energy efficient operation based on digitalisation</b>. The <i>availability of real-time information</i> on the status of the system will lead to the possibility to minimise energy demand while complying with operational constraints. Energy efficiency will be improved through optimised driving modes performed by <i>Automated Train Operation and Supervision (ATO and ATS)</i> and <i>real time fully Connected Driver Advisory System (CDAS)</i>;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>holistic energy efficiency / management approach for rolling stock</b>. The <i>efficiency of individual subsystems</i> may be optimised with the adoption of suitable technologies. With <i>more efficient propulsion systems</i> and <i>a holistic approach</i> including non-traction functions, such as heating, lighting, air conditioning and air production, a significant global reduction of the energy consumption can be achieved. Additional optimisation of the energy consumption is achieved through <b>new rolling stock concepts</b>, full-electric service brakes and smart sub-systems, materials and technologies aiming also at reducing weight;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>develop smart energy infrastructure</b>. <i>On board and line-side energy storage technologies and charging technologies</i> will make possible to recover a big amount of the braking energy and will support balancing the flow of energy. Electricity supply using <i>SMART Grid technologies</i> coupled with increasing the residence and variety of supply resources (e.g. main grid, local renewable, recovered, etc.), not only for rail traction systems but also for road usage and stations.
