<h3>Simulation tools and procedures to accurately predict noise emissions and vibrations</h3>
<p>
	As social sensitivity to noise levels grow, the incentive to reduce noise and vibration levels both inside and outside vehicles increases. Specific technological enablers to be developed are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>analysis methods for structure borne noise and for airborne train interior noise propagation.</b> Because noise is a complex technical issue, there is an increasing need of improving prediction. These will support the identification of the most suitable noise and vibration mitigation measures, and in many cases enable accurate performance prediction during the early design phase, reducing overall costs. Sound quality aspects are also important to include, for the future competitiveness of rail versus other modes of transport and hence as a support for the modal shift required for decarbonisation;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>virtual authorisation of vehicles.</b> This will progress due to the increase in reliability of the simulations carried out and the procedures for allowing this to be installed and tested. Accuracy of the exterior noise propagation prediction will also be improved (including barriers, etc.).

	</ul>
