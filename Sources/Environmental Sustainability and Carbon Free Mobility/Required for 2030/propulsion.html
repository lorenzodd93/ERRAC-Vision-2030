<h3>Development of affordable alternative propulsion for non-electrified lines</h3>
<p>
	Different <i>technologies that may provide an alternative to diesel propulsion</i> for freight and passenger transport in nonelectrified lines are already under development. They need to be evolved to the point that technical and economic feasibility can be shown before they are fully recognised as legitimate substitutes of diesel traction. It is likely that different technologies may end up being successful in niche markets/applications with different requirements. Specific enablers to be developed are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>development of Future On-board Energy Storage Systems (ESS)</b> and charging technologies will facilitate the conservation of energy by reducing the average energy consumption and may also provide with a technological alternative to diesel propulsion;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>identification and demonstration of suitable alternative propulsion systems</b>. The generic development of technologies with the potential to provide viable alternatives to diesel (e.g. fuel cells or batteries) and the adaptation to the specificities of railways needs to be considered. To cover the case of partially electrified lines, hybrid operation should also be studied;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>study and develop new energy supply infrastructure in a full society context, i.e. combined systems for rail, road usage</b>. Production of energy could be undertaken centrally and distributed or locally depending on the electrical grid and production methods. Finally, the source of energy must be studied, in a real well-to-wheel concept.
