<h3>Procedures and techniques for recycling vehicles and eliminating polluting substances</h3>
<p>
	Ensuring <i>eco-friendliness</i> will require the <i>recycling/dismantling aspects of new technology components implemented in Shift2Rail</i>, such as new generation batteries, composite components, etc. to be addressed. Also, the reduction or elimination of emissions of dust, especially particulate matter, environment polluting substances such as oil is essential to the railway being the backbone of environment friendly mobility.
</p>
<p>
	The impacts and values of these activities will be:
	<ul>
		<li>support carbon-free freight and passenger railway transport by developing <i>cost-effective and widely applicable alternative propulsion</i> for non-electrified railway lines, also facilitating multi-modal production and storage systems;</li>
		<li>storage and use of excess electricity from renewable sources;</li>
		<li>reduce the cost of the railway system by <i>reducing the need for building and maintaining electrification infrastructure</i> in low density lines due to clean alternative propulsion systems;</li>
		<li>reduce the total carbon footprint of railways by <i>reducing the total energy consumption</i>, as a result of the increased efficiency;</li>
		<li>reduce the total LCC of railways by reducing the total energy consumption, resulting from the increased efficiency;</li>
		<li>noise and vibration levels to be reduced to facilitate increased rail traffic without increased disturbance, increased comfort and use of rail transport in comparison to other transport means and reduce costs by improving simulation techniques allowing optimisation in early design phases and a development towards virtual authorisation.</li>
		<li>In general, support the achievement of institutional objectives and long-term policies through the reduction of all types of emissions.</li>
	</ul>
