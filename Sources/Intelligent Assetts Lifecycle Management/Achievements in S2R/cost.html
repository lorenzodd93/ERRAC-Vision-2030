<h3>Cost Efficient and Reliable High Capacity Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
	Within Cost Efficient and Reliable High Capacity Infrastructure the <b>Asset Maintenance Pillar</b> has been a driver to deliver innovative Asset Management in the railway sector, meeting the best practice set out in ISO55000, creating optimised data measuring, monitoring, processing & maintenance strategies, processes and methodologies, for the implementation of a step change in risk based, prescriptive analytics and holistic Asset Management in the rail sector. Deep new knowledge of the critical assets of rail infrastructure and their deformation mechanisms is developed, while innovative measuring techniques that are based on state-of-the-art technologies (such as robotics, satellite & drones) are tested on the field. This can feed directly into a new program. The function and optimisation of the mechanical infrastructure has been developed for reducing the environmental impact and costs.
