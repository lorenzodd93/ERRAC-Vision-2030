<h3>Integration and benefits</h3>
<p>
	To move towards these ambitions, it is now crucial to <b>integrate existing infrastructure</b> construction and maintenance methods, technical bricks delivered by R&I programs, in particular Shift2Rail, thus facilitating the introduction of further innovations. This will enable the delivery of new solutions enhancing railway performance:
	<ul>
		<li>digitalisation of the maintenance system;</li>
		<li>prognosis and Health Assessment at System Level;</li>
		<li>specific Technologies for Maintenance Execution;</li>
		<li>new construction methods;</li>
		<li>new calculation methods and more powerful computers allow studying in further depth classical and/or basic problems for example related to wheel-rail contact.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	A whole life asset approach will deliver two key benefits:
	<ul> 
		<li>Should reduce the overall cost to maintain the asset over its life cycle;</li>
		<li>Should also release constraints for migration at subsystem level, by a better alignment between asset and technology life cycles.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Starting from the achievements of Shift2Rail, the proposed concept that will bring asset management to the next level requires progress in the <i>digitalisation of the whole system and its components</i>, with a special focus on integration aspects that will enable its holistic management. Then, the <i>opportunities brought by advanced technologies</i> should be developed into specific solutions to the key problems in the design, building operation and maintenance of the whole rail system.
