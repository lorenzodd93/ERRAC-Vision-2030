<h3>New construction methods</h3>
<p>
	The components and structures in the rail system are based on traditional systems. New construction methods will adapt the systems to the novel concepts of design, construction and maintenance; thus reducing costs and environmental impact, while building-in a low failure rate. It will also adapt the system to fast, cost efficient automated maintenance by:
	<ul>
		<li>
			design reducing the number of components, and their linked dependency;
		</li>
		<li>
			moving critical functions away from the trackside to an environment where access is safer and easier, with more backups, e.g. the cloud;
		</li>
		<li>
			building-in smart components that can be much better tailored and suitable for on-line supervision;
		</li>
		<li>
			developing smart and lean components, track and structures;
		</li>
		<li>
			modular components that can be easily exchanged by automated plug-and-play solutions avoiding onsite repair.
		</li> 
	</ul>
	Overall, the proposed activity will result in increased and enhanced operational flexibility and will contribute to a more safe, robust, resilient, and reliable service as well as faster recovery from service disruption, along with a reduction of LCC.
</p>
<p>
	This will happen due to the following specific impacts achieved by the proposed activities:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>24/24 and 7/7 system availability</b>: Optimised interface maintenance keeps the railway continuously open, fostering minimal disruption to train services improving system reliability;
		</li>
		<li>
			A significant <b>reduction of the life cycle cost</b> of the rail system, supported by an improved management of the interfaces between subsystems;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Optimising network capacity</b>: Intelligent maintenance increases train and track availability and reduces perturbations and delays;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Minimising the need of on-side activities</b>: Reduction of downtime by using autonomous systems monitoring themselves and sending information and alarms on their status can achieve the capability for remote and just-in-time maintenance. Digital Twins support the maintenance logistics resulting in minimum impact and in first-time-right interventions;
