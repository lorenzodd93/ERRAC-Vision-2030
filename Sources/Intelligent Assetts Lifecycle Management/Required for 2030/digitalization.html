<h3>Digitalisation of the maintenance system</h3>
<p>
	Rail maintenance is based on manual knowledge and established practises. With evolving digitalisation, maintenance can be based on smart components and smart decisions. The rail system can have a digital copy on-line and in real-time:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>self-diagnostic, self-repairing and self-adjusting assets</b>, through the development of Internet of Things IoT, making it possible for assets to update their own records and ‘self-heal’ to be applied on modular components;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>artificial Intelligence will bring real-time maintenance forecasting and servicing assets</b> (maintenance execution). With large amounts of data available — such as maintenance history, actual usage of the assets and monitoring, AI can identify the correct time for the required interventions to avoid failures and disruption of the operation;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>concepts, procedures and regulations</b> for the introduction of safety relevant AI based tools and methods;	
		</li>
		<li>
			integration of <b>‘Digital twins’</b> in the asset management process supporting the operational process including the logistics for the execution of maintenance by simulating complex interventions and supporting the multi-disciplinary teams;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Data Digital Market</b> for the integration of heterogeneous data coming from different organisations defining the process for exchanging data, ownership and revenues;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Block Chain and Smart Contracts</b>: Block chain platforms, established in the financial sector, are becoming applicable platforms also in industrial contexts and the market for such platforms and smart contracts are growing rapidly. Such platforms need to be considered in future railway applications.
		</li>	 
	</ul>
