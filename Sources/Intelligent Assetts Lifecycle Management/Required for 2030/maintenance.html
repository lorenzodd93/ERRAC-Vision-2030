<h3>Specific Technologies for Maintenance Execution</h3>
<p>
	Maintenance is quite manual today, executed with the support of machines. In a future digital system, the machines will be more and more able to do the maintenance themselves, reducing the costs, risks and the lead time before the actual repair. The works can be done by mobile units or by the components themselves; further reducing down time, especially at odd hours:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>automated identification and automatic assets recognition and monitoring</b> as the basis of precise service operation;
		</li>
		<li>
			increased <b>automated maintenance execution</b> from a robotic perspective, towards a final maintenance execution from an automated robotic platform
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>advanced augmented reality technologies</b> (e.g. computer vision and object recognition) applied to remote maintenance operations;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>robotics</b> using principles like swarm robotics and biomimicry creating small and easy to use tools making the physical work easier avoiding unhealthy and heavy work including development of Human Machine Interfaces;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>modular components</b> that can be easily exchanged by automated plug-and-play solutions avoiding onsite repair.
		</li> 
	</ul>
