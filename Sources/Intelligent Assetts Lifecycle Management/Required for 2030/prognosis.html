<h3>Prognosis and Health Assessment at System Level</h3>
<p>
	Asset management is developing in all sectors. By applying the best knowledge into the rail sector, a substantial reduction in costs can be achieved. Inspections and checks can be made without personnel on the tracks, reducing risks and costs, while it can be done more frequently. AI will collect and store a vast amount of human knowledge:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>LCC automated models</b> able to evaluate how to prevent a failure will influence the operational costs of maintenance and how much an asset management decision will affect the overall LCC;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Reliability and criticality models of system / Sub-system behaviour</b> able to automatically assess how an asset failure affects the entire system performance;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Transfer available human expert knowledge</b> about legacy assets into AI expert systems / sub-systems and self-learning AI expert systems / sub-systems based on cognitive computing providing interpretable diagnosis, prediction and maintenance planning information;
		</li>
		<li>
			Development of <b>Human Machine Interfaces</b> based on augmented reality and natural language processing for interaction of human operators with AI expert systems / sub-systems for diagnosis, prognosis and maintenance planning;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Increased automated inspection from a robotic perspective</b>, towards a final execution from an automated robotic platform.
		</li> 
	</ul>
