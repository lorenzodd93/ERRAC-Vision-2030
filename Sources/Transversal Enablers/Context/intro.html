<h1>Transversal Enablers</h1>
<p>
	Rail sector engineering, logistics, manufacturing and maintenance will benefit from some transversal enablers, in particular digital technologies. This has been confirmed in pilot projects and other sectors where value was added to the whole supply chain of the sector, by reducing lead-time to delivery, manufacturing on demand, reducing storage, reducing goods transport cost and enabling stronger collaboration between supplier, manufacturer and railway operator/infrastructure manager.
