<h1>Intelligent Assets Lifecycle Management</h1>
<h3>Whole-Life Asset Approach</h3>
<p>
	One of the main potentials of the digital transformation is the possibility of increasing the (cost) efficiency of the asset management process and profitability of assets themselves through decision support systems based on the comprehensive digital monitoring of railway systems – “smart data”. Analysing the huge volumes of Big Data provides the basis for efficient and risk-based decision-making. The focus lies in:
	<ul>
		<li>ensuring maximum railway network availability and reliability;</li> 
		<li>reducing life cycle costs (LCC).</li> 
	</ul>
	The knowledge will also feed back into the design and construction or manufacturing loop.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, to maximise the possible impact of this potential, <i>railways need to be understood as a single system where moving and fixed elements work together</i>, replacing the conventional approach of addressing each subsystem separately.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>major challenge</b> in this context is to <i>adopt a holistic view involving every subsystem in the infrastructure and vehicles and considering their interfaces</i>. Such a global approach to assets and their management will result in increased and enhanced operational flexibility and contribute to a more robust, resilient, and reliable service as well as faster recovery from service disruption, along with a reduction in the cost.
