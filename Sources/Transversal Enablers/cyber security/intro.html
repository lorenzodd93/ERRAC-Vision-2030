<h1>Cyber Security</h1>
<p>
	In the digital era, the protection of every sub-system against cyber-attacks is becoming critical, as most of the systems are now connected. <i>The rail sector will not develop specific cyber protection but will use the best of the existing technologies</i>. The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) has initiated regulations that enforce cybersecurity system accreditation.
</p>
<p>
	The objective is to <b>ensure that every European rail transport network is secured properly and can detect efficiently security incidents</b>. To achieve this, a precondition is to enhance European collaboration.
</p>
<p>
	One of the main difficulties is that deployed systems have a long lifespan that make them particularly difficult to maintain at the right security level. New vulnerabilities are discovered continuously and patching may take time for Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL4) systems. The new architectures and protocols should take this into account.
</p>
<p>
	Research and innovation on cyber security will deliver benefit when easing the identification and resolution of vulnerabilities and accelerating the introduction in the rail system of state of the art cybersecure technology.
</p>
<p>
	To improve cyber security, key enablers are identified and should be supported by collaborative RDI activities.
