<h1>Required for 2020-2030</h1>
<p>
	The following interlinked steps have been started in Shift2Rail and shall be continued and developed into system solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Collaborative design of on-board and infrastructure systems/subsystems</b> based on cutting-edge innovative technologies and bring it to approaches for integrated measuring and monitoring the root causes of degradation/failure of critical assets integrated with IoT based paradigm and minimising the cost and impact of the solution (based on Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Infrastructure to Infrastructure (I2I) and V2V communication solutions);
		</li> 
		<li>
			<b>The completion of the standardisation phase for the Shift2Rail Conceptual Data Model</b>, the seamless interface with existing railway-related information in the different EU contexts;
	   	</li> 
	   	<li>
			The <b>integration of the present and newly developed heterogeneous sources of information</b> to be shared between stakeholders. Develop the analysis of big data for the nowcasting and forecasting of assetsâ€™ condition, diagnosis and prescriptive maintenance.
	   	</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, it will be necessary to progress in the following areas: <b>Digitalisation of the maintenance system, Prognosis and Health Assessment at System Level, Specific Technologies for Maintenance Execution, and New construction methods.</b>
