<h1>Digital Technologies (e.g. Big Data, AI, General Intelligence)</h1>
<p>
	The development of Digital Technologies, such as Data Science, Data Services, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neuronal Networks, Blockchain, Self -learning systems, Cognitive Computing and Cloud Computing, already had a big impact in railway field and they will become increasingly important. 
</p>
<p>
	The usage of Digital Technologies in railways aims to deliver various benefits:
	<ul>
		<li>fast and efficient decision-making;</li>
		<li>increasing reliability;</li>
		<li>reducing costs;</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Achievements in Shift2Rail</h3>
<p>
	Shift2Rail contributes to the development of Big Data Analytics in the railway field. The large amount of heterogeneous information requires a lot of attention in data management. Shift2Rail <b>provides an open, standardised, seamless and secure access to data</b>, covering aspects such as:
	<ul>
		<li>transaction of Intellectual Property Right (IPR);</li>
		<li>protected Business to Business data;</li> 
		<li>management of data with safety-critical impact;</li>
		<li>strict information assurance;</li>
		<li>related quality control procedures on data and quality gates.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Data processing through analytics techniques, such as <b>anomaly detection, asset decay prediction, process mining and prescriptive maintenance</b>, contribute to the improvement of interventions and activities related to railways:
	<ul>
		<li>increase of asset status monitoring capabilities through anomaly detection;</li>
		<li>more targeted maintenance interventions based on railway asset decay prediction, increasing operational reliability (less service disruption);</li>
		<li>maintenance activities optimisation through predictive maintenance, guaranteeing a cost reduction both in terms of spare parts and in terms of effort;</li>
		<li>LCC reduction based on condition-based maintenance of railway assets and continuous improvement of components/maintenance schedules.</li>
	</ul>

	In its <b>Programme on IT Solutions for Attractive Railway Services</b> Shift2Rail proposes <i>Business Analytics developments to improve the interaction between the passengers and the operator’s networks</i>: assessing the best offer for a passenger accounting for their preferences and previous journeys, and the real time knowledge of the multi-modal transport offer and constraints. Business Analytics is also used to provide the operators an accurate feedback of the passenger’s needs, and to adapt their offer accordingly.

	In order to get the best benefit from digital technologies, some enablers will be worked out.
