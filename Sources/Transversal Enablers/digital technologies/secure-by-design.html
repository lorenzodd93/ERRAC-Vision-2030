	The <b>Railway ICT ecosystem should be designed to be “secure by design”</b> <i>moving from an “intrusion detection” paradigm to an “intrusion resilient” one</i> to anticipate, mitigate and, in any case, detect security threats to the railway digital ecosystem. As the complexity of this ecosystem increases, new approaches and techniques should be developed or adapted from other applications fields to achieve secure and trusted operation inside and between each information system.
