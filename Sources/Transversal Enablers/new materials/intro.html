<h1>New Materials and Manufacturing Techniques</h1>
<p>
	It is now of great importance to <b>integrate new materials and manufacturing techniques, benefiting from developments in other sectors (Aerospace, Defence, etc) and undertaking the required adjustments for the railway ecosystem</b>.
</p>
<p>
	New materials and manufacturing techniques will contribute to <i>better products and new maintenance concepts</i>. They will also contribute to a ‘circular economy’ while supporting performance improvements (e.g. energy saving with less weight).
</p>
<p>
	To develop new materials and manufacturing techniques, some key enablers are identified:
	<ul>
		<li>New material validation;</li>
		<li>Additive manufacturing;</li>
		<li>New manufacturing technical for maintenance.</li>
	</ul>
	Focus is required in the life cycle of new materials and closed cycle waste management systems towards 100% level of recycling. This needs also attention for all legacy components.
