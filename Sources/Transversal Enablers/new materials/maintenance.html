<h3>Manufacturing Techniques for Maintenance</h3>
<p>
	Manufacturing techniques in the context of maintenance will benefit from <b>robotics</b>. The introduction of robotics in the rail sector can benefit from principles like swarm robotics. Avoiding the need for an autonomous vehicle to occupy whole sections of a track, <i>robots should be able to access and leave the track near the location where the work is needed</i>. A whole set of light and small robots could enter the track based on the theory based on swarm behaviour seen in ant and bee colonies. The idea is that small individual robots working towards a larger goal by distributing the work. The idea of swarm robotics is commonplace is the research of the application of robotics across various sectors. Using biomimicry will also help to find solutions to make light and small robots be fit for task were power and strength is required.
