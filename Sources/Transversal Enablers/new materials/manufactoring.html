<h3>Additive Manufacturing</h3>
<p>
	The challenge is in the part design coupled with low volume series production (today’s cost impact vs traditional manufacturing processes) and associated railway sector requirements (reduced weight, mechanical resistance, …). However, the focus should also integrate the <i>potential higher complexity of parts that can be manufactured by optimising the functionalities offered by these parts</i>. Additive manufacture also reduces the need for post-process quality control as digitalisation offers more opportunities for on-line quality control. The additive manufacturing process should be optimised in terms of <i>surface finishing</i> and <i>part design (topology)</i>. Evaluation should be undertaken on which manufacturing technologies are relevant for the rail industry from economic, quality and technical perspectives.
