	Today, metals, thermoplastics and photopolymers are the most frequently used materials for additive manufacture. New materials are arriving, with quite unknown but multiple properties. Evaluating these materials and driving the relevant material validation is key in the railway domain, while recognising that these steps are expensive and time consuming. It will allow the sector to define what is suitable from a technical and economical perspective for the stakeholders.
