<h1>How to Ensure Migration to 2030</h1>
<p>
	Rail services are an easily accessible form of transport with reasonable security measures. <i>Security is managed by</i> <b>specific human resources</b> working closely with public police, supported by some specific systems (scan, etc.) and railways are rather secure. However, an issue for attractiveness is the subjective feeling of insecurity:
	<ul>
		<li><b>terrorism is a permanent threat</b> and the rail mode with the high density of people using it is a potential target.</li> 
		<li><b>Violence and vandalism</b> (e.g. graffiti) in the public transport environment is creating stress among passengers and staff.</li> 
		<li><b>Criminals</b>, whatever the degree of severity of their wrong-doings, are damaging the image of the services and are a threat to passengers, staff, goods and assets.</li>
	</ul>
	Any successful security policy is a mix of people (awareness, preparedness, trainingâ€¦), processes and products/technologies.
</p>
<p>
	Research and innovation on reasonable security measures will deliver benefit in the perception of society related to transport insecurity and in the efficiency of security threat resolution.
</p>
<p>
	To achieve advanced interoperable train control systems, key enablers are identified and should be supported by collaborative RDI activities.
