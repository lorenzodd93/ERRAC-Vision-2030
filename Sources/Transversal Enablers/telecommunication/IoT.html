<h1>How to Ensure Migration to 2030</h1>
<p>
	Horizon Europe is expected to support an integrated approach to maintenance based on digital and automated solutions, and to take the most valuable new technologies to a high maturity level for implementation in railways.
</p>
<p>
	This requires:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>standardisation of critical aspects of the digital system</b> (such as interfaces, protocols, communications, data structures) required to integrate the different subsystems;
		</li>
		<li>
			development of an <b>open framework<b> that enables <i>use of data and information by different stakeholders</i> involved in operation and maintenance;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>deployment analysis of new maintenance concepts</b>; within each project these aspects must be considered, and their feasibility proven;
		</li>
		<li>
			automation of <b>maintenance adoption</b> in procedures and rules/regulation;
		</li>
		<li>
			promotion of <b>effective integration</b> into existing information systems.
		</li> 
	</ul>
