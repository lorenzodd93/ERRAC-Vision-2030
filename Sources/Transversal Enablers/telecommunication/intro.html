<h1>Telecommunication</h1>
<p>
	Several major trends have been transforming the Information Technology (IT) and communications world in the recent years:
	<ul>
		<li>virtualisation of functions;</li>
		<li>cloud-based infrastructures and services;</li>
		<li>the rise of Everything-as-a-Service;</li>
		<li>data becoming the new oil;</li>
		<li>and the constant need for cybersecurity.</li>
	</ul>

</p>
<p>
	The impact on the rail industry is the irreversible <b>migration from closed legacy systems to “Digital Railways”</b> calling for cheaper, open, and interoperable solutions, with a true integration of technologies to cater for end-to-end service delivery, including more mobile broadband radio for operations and passengers, IoT connectivity and data monetisation, whilst ensuring cybersecurity by design.
</p>
<p>
	<i>Fast changing communication technologies need to be reconciled with the longer lifecycles of rail-specific standards</i> such as <b>ETCS</b> and Communications-based train control (<b>CBTC</b>). The suitability of the various telecom options has been extensively analysed by the <b>FP7 European NGTC project</b> and clear strategic pathways have been defined for future bearer neutral, scalable and fail-safe data transmission.
</p>
<p>
	However, prior to any developments and deployment in data transmission, <i>railways need to ensure availability of and access to bandwidth resource for fail-safe operation</i>. In the context of road ITS developments the existing exclusivity of bandwidth resources for railway and metro applications is no longer guaranteed and solutions needs to be developed avoid third-party interference in both mainline AND urban applications. This requires continuous action at regulatory and technical levels. Failing to obtain this pre-requisite will jeopardise all efforts to increase rail capacity and quality of service.
</p>
<p>
	Research and innovation on telecommunication for railway will bring benefit by reducing asset cost and facilitating successive migration to state of the art connectivity standard. Solutions will become modular, systems integration will consistently address all needs, in a future-proof, cost-effective, and secure manner.

<h3>Achievements in Shift2Rail</h3>
<p>
	Telecommunication is addressed in Shift2Rail (via the wireless TCMS and Train to Ground Communications). An important achievement is the <b>delivery of requirements for Train to Ground Communications</b>.
</p>
<p>
	They do not only <i>provide a foundation for the telecommunication architectural specification</i>, they also <i>support business model development, and requirements for applications interfacing with the telecommunications</i> (e.g. train integrity and communications with remote maintenance vehicles) avoiding as far as possible any specific railway solution to <b>reduce LCC</b>.

</p>
<p>
	New telecommunications technologies and capabilities such as those being developed under the <b>‘5G’</b> umbrella are emerging. The focus is put on shifting from a network as an asset to a network as a service (NaaS) model.
